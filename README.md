# Details: Grid Menu Noclick

## What
I made a widget called "Grid menu Noclick". When enabled, this widget overrides the "Grid menu" widget and disables almost all mouse-clicking functionality on the grid menu for both builders and factories.

## ...but Why?
Some of my clanmates are interested in playing practice games with hotkeys-only building, and this widget lets them do that. There's no competitive advantage or QoL benefit of any sort to using this widget, so the only reason to install this would be if you, too, want to practice with hotkeys-only.

This widget supersedes the "Grid menu" widget and will disable that widget when installed! <br>
To re-enable the "Grid menu" widget, please first disable this widget.
